The jury didn’t find Michael Sussman guilty after reaching a verdict by not considering their political opinions. Politics “was not a factor,” the jury forewoman, who declined to give her name, said, adding that she believed it had been foolish to bring the case.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/media.ghgossip.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/19142718/124794780_tv076077740.jpg><p>Michael Sussman’s wife, Dr. Apple Sussman, is a pediatrician who practices in Bethesda, Maryland, and is a Castle Connolly Top Doctor. Since they got married in 2002, the couple has been together for about 20 years. They tied the knot on September 22, 2002, in Boston. Michael and Apple seem to be keeping their family a secret as there’s nothing about their kids hence we can’t tell for certain if they have children or not.</p><p>Michael Sussman is the son of Judith A. Sussmann and Herbert Sussmann. His father, Herbert, was the owner of Ranger Rugs, a former manufacturer in Adairsville, Georgia, where he worked on sales and design from Old Tappan.
