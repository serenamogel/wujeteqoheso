Here are just a few of Brunson’s wildest true stories.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">#1. His cancer suddenly disappeared.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doyle Brunson was only 29 years old when he was told he had three months to live. After he discovered a lump on his neck, doctors found an advanced form of melanoma progressing upward from his neck toward his brain. Brunson was told to get his affairs in order, and he only hoped to live long enough to see the birth of his daughter, Louisa.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But when it came time to operate, Brunson's doctors were shocked to discover the cancer had disappeared, seemingly completely on its own. “They said sometimes they see one or two cases of spontaneous remission,” Brunson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.poker.org/hollywood-dolly-doyle-brunson-is-about-to-have-a-big-year/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="told Poker.org" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>told Poker.org</u></a>. “They had no explanation for it.”</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">#2. He witnessed a shooting during a poker game.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Brunson’s career as a professional poker player started with a bang—literally. In his early years, Brunson frequently played on a particularly dangerous street in Fort Worth, Texas <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pokertube.com/article/top-5-doyle-brunson-poker-stories data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="called “Bloodthirsty Highway.”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>called “Bloodthirsty Highway.”</u></a> During his first year as a pro, Brunson claimed he was playing in a pool hall there when someone came in and shot another player in the head.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“His brains seemed to splatter all over the wall,” Brunson <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://twitter.com/TexDolly/status/1263536722475798528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1263536722475798528%7Ctwgr%5Ebfd8178af160a184041adb1b21ab147db3914c62%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pokertube.com%2Farticle%2Ftop-5-doyle-brunson-poker-stories" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="said of the incident" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>said of the incident</u></a> on Twitter. “We all ran out the back door to keep from talking to cops.

He won two straight championships with a bad hand.<br></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A 10 and 2 of any suit isn’t typically a great starting hand in poker, but it is known as <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/doyle-brunson-10-time-world-series-poker-champion/story?id=99321670" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the “Doyle Brunson hand”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>the “Doyle Brunson hand”</u></a> because Brunson famously won two back-to-back No Limit Hold ‘Em events at the World Series of Poker while holding that hand in the final play.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Both in 1976 and 1977, Brunson was the underdog holding the 10-2, with his opponent having him beat until the “river card,” or the final card flipped by the dealer.

He rebuffed threats from a mobster.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doyle Brunson has stared down some big bluffs in his day, but none compare to the time he called the bluff of Tony “The Ant” Spilotro. The infamous Las Vegas mobster—who is believed to have killed at least 20 people, and inspired the character played by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/joe-pesci data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Joe Pesci" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Joe Pesci</u></a> in the film Casino (1995)—reportedly demanded a 25 percent cut of Brunson’s poker winnings.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“If you don’t like it, I’ll stick 12 ice picks in that big fat gut of yours,” Spilotro <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2022/06/14/poker-legend-doyle-brunson-vegas-mobster-threatened-my-life/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="allegedly told Brunson" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>allegedly told Brunson</u></a>, to which Brunson replied, “You can’t kill everyone.” Brunson never paid, and he believed his connections with Benny Binion—the former mob boss who founded the World Series of Poker—helped protect him from any retribution from Spilotro.</p><h2 data-node-id=19 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">#5. He faked a heart attack during a robbery.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Brunson claimed he had been robbed <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pokertube.com/article/did-someone-try-to-rob-doyle-brunson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="at least five times" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>at least five times</u></a> in his life, including one instance in which he faked a heart attack to confuse the robbers.

The robbers made off with $4,000 in cash and $80,000 in chips. After that, Brunson said he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pokertube.com/article/did-someone-try-to-rob-doyle-brunson data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="carried a gun" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>carried a gun</u></a> with him at all times.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">#6. A man died after losing a hand to him.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Doyle Brunson once beat an opponent in a hand so badly that he died, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/doyle-brunson-poker-legend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Texas Monthly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>according to </u><u>Texas Monthly</u></a>. Red Dodson was playing Brunson in a poker variation that rewarded having low cards. After getting bluffed by Brunson all night, Dodson was dealt an ace, two, three, four, and six, the second-best hand possible in this version of the game.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After betting big, Dodson turned over his cards, confident in his victory until Brunson revealed ace, two, three, four, five—the only hand that could beat him. Dodson's eyes allegedly rolled back, he started turning blue, then he fell out of his chair, dead before he hit the floor. Brunson collected the pot while awaiting paramedics: “I felt bad, but that’s poker, and bad beats happen.”</p><img alt="bodogcom presents card players player of the year awards press room" title="Bodog.com Presents Card Players Player of the Year Awards - Press Room" width=1993 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doyle-brunson-during-bodog-com-presents-card-players-news-photo-1684180839.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">John Sciulli</span><span class="css-180xbpm eewc14j0">//</span><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">#7. He made a $235 million miscalculation.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Many virtual poker rooms were created during the online poker boom in the early 2010s, and Brunson got in on the action. His site, called Doyle’s Room, generated a great deal of interest due to his name branding, and Brunson claimed at one point in 2011 he <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.pokernewsdaily.com/doyle-brunson-once-turned-down-235-million-for-doyles-room-33659/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="was offered $235 million" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>was offered $235 million</u></a> for the room, but he turned it down because he believed it was worth more.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Unfortunately for Doyle, shortly after he rejected the offer, the federal government cracked down on virtual poker during what became known among the community <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://archive.nytimes.com/fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/20/after-black-friday-american-poker-faces-cloudy-future/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="as “Black Friday,”" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>as “Black Friday,”</u></a> significantly reducing the value of his site. “That haunts me to this day,” <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.poker.org/doyle-brunson-turned-down-235-million-offer-because-it-wasnt-enough-money/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Brunson said" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>Brunson said</u></a>. “I thought it was going to be worth twice that and it would have been.

He made a $1 million bet to lose weight.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During a 2003 poker game, Doyle Brunson’s weight had become such a problem that he had trouble standing up from the table, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.texasmonthly.com/arts-entertainment/doyle-brunson-poker-legend/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="according to Texas Monthly" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10"><u>according to </u><u>Texas Monthly</u></a>. He told the other players he needed to lose 100 pounds, and they offered him 10-to-1 odds that he couldn’t lose the weight in two years. Brunson took the bet, putting up $100,000, meaning he’d get $1 million if he won.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After going one year and several months without losing any weight, Brunson went on a diet and the pounds started dropping rapidly. With a few weeks to go, he was down 98 pounds, and his friends offered him $980,000 to end the bet early.
