He's not very nice and is kind of ugly.</span></span><h2>Why does Mr. D not like Percy?</h2>Dionysus greatly dislikes Percy Jackson because he's a hero, even more so because he is a son of Poseidon, like Theseus. He is often irritated by Percy, and he votes for Percy to be killed at the Olympian Council during The Titan's Curse.<h2>Who is Mr. D in Percy Jackson?</h2>In the Percy Jackson books, the director of Camp Halfblood is Mr. D, AKA, Dionysus. It's explained that he's there because he chased after Zeus's favorite wood nymph, and was sentenced to guard Camp Halfblood for one hundred years.<h2>What does Mr. D want to do to Percy?</h2>Mr. D is on his way to Mount Olympus for a meeting, and he says that if Percy is still at Camp Half-Blood when he returns, he'll turn him into a dolphin for sure. Percy wants to know what this "quest" business is all about.<h2>Is Mr. D Dionysus in Percy Jackson?</h2>Dionysus is introduced as Mr. D and is called by this throughout the series by Percy. Dionysus is first seen playing pinochle with Chiron, described by him as one of the best games (along with Pac-Man and gladiator fighting) invented by humans.<h2>Percy Jackson - Mr. D.</h2><p></p><h2>How does Percy feel about Mr. D Chapter 5?</h2>Percy is so happy to see his favorite teacher. Mr. D is the director of Camp Half-Blood, and he reminds Percy of Smelly Gabe. He's not very nice and is kind of ugly.<h2>Who was the ugliest god?</h2>Hephaestus. Hephaestus is the son of Zeus and Hera. Sometimes it is said that Hera alone produced him and that he has no father. He is the only god to be physically ugly.<h2>Why is Percy so surprised when he learns Mr D true identity?</h2>Why is Percy so surprised when he learns Mr. D's true identity? Mr. D is in fact Dionysus, but he doesn't look or act like a god.<h2>What clues help Percy guess Mr D's?</h2>What clues help Percy guess Mr. D's identity? He had bloodshot eyes and heaved a great sigh.<h2>What does Luke Castellan look like?</h2>Appearance. In The Lost Hero, a photo shows a 15-year-old Luke - a sandy blonde haired boy with a mischievous smile. He wore a ragged makeshift leather armor over his T-shirt. Luke is described as a tall, college-aged young man with an athletic, muscular build.<h2>What is Mr. D personality?</h2>Since running a summer camp for kids is the last thing Mr. D wants to do, he does the bare minimum and leaves as much of the actual caretaking and nurturing to others, like Chiron. Instead, Mr. D settles for rude, curt, and cursory announcements, and he spends as much time as possible playing games.<h2>What is Mr. D's real name?</h2>D is a Canadian television series starring comedian Gerry Dee. The series follows the misadventures of an underqualified schoolteacher named Gerry Duncan, nicknamed Mr. D.<h2>Who did Percy first meet god?</h2>Ares curses Percy. Percy returns the helm of darkness to Hades and takes a plane to New York City where he finds Mount Olympus on the 600th floor of the Empire State Building. Percy meets Poseidon and Zeus for the first time and tells them everything that he knows and suspects.<h2>What does Sally Jackson look like?</h2>Appearance. Sally is a strikingly beautiful woman with a smile as warm as a quilt and sparkling blue eyes that change of color in the light. Her hair is long and brown with a few streaks of grey, but Percy stated that he never thought of her as old.<h2>What is Leo Valdez's full name?</h2>Leonidas "Leo" Valdez was born in Houston, Texas, to the mechanic Esperanza Valdez, and the blacksmith god Hephaestus. Unlike most of his half-siblings, Leo can control fire. He was the first child of Hephaestus to control fire born in centuries.<h2>What does Aphrodite look like in Percy Jackson?</h2>In The Titan's Curse, Aphrodite was portrayed as wearing a red satin dress, with hair curled in a cascade of ringlets, perfect makeup, dazzling eyes like pools of spring water, and a smile that would have lit up the dark side of the moon.<h2>What page does Annabeth say you drool in your sleep?</h2>Page 198. I tried not to drool in my sleep, since Annabeth was sitting right next to me.<h2>What does Percy realize about himself?</h2>What does Percy finally realize about his father and himself? His father is one of the Olympians. He is a God. Percy is half human and half god.<h2>How long has Annabeth been at Camp Half-Blood?</h2>Annabeth lived at Camp Half-Blood for five years prior to Percy Jackson's arrival. It has been shown that Annabeth does not get along with her father and step-family.<h2>Who was after Percy?</h2>He says that Grover is a donkey. According to Grover, who is after Percy? The lord of the dead and a few of his bloodthirsty minions.<h2>What happens at the end of Percy Jackson?</h2>He dies peacefully, and the Fates themselves carry his body away. The gods grant rewards to several heroes who were instrumental in defeating the Titans, including Thalia, Grover, Annabeth, Tyson, Clarisse, and Nico. Finally, Percy is called forward. Zeus offers him the greatest gift of all time: immortal godhood.<h2>Where did Percy think someone was watching him?</h2>Percy sees someone watching him from the attic of the farmhouse, but Chiron assures him that nothing lives up there. Chiron takes Percy to the cabins where the campers live.<h2>Who is the god of poop?</h2>Sterculius, the Roman God of Feces.<h2>Who is the god of stupidity?</h2>In Greek mythology, Koalemos (Ancient Greek: Κοάλεμος) was the god of stupidity, mentioned once by Aristophanes, and being found also in Parallel Lives by Plutarch.
