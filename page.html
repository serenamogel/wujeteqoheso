I know, I know, the winter is not so bad here in Austin, but I feel for those of you up north, because I used to be one of you. I live for warm&nbsp;sunny days, so I made this cabbage salad of bright winter produce with you in mind – to send some love – and lemons…&nbsp;and well, also some clementines. What’s in this Cabbage Salad Recipe? This recipe includes two major categories of ingredients. You start with a base of crispy veggies: Cabbage –&nbsp;&nbsp;Tender napa cabbage or savoy…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>There’s nothing better than having a vibrant salad dressing on hand in the fridge during a busy work week. When you’re strapped for time, a yummy sauce can make even the simplest meal feel satisfying. Lately, whipping up this citrus miso dressing has been my go-to. It’s a bright,&nbsp;tangy combination of clementine, lemon, miso, garlic, and ginger.&nbsp;In addition to tasting delicious, all of these ingredients have detoxifying properties&nbsp;– so consider this dressing a little health kick too! How to Use Miso Dressing Once you make this miso salad dressing, you’ll use it on everything. Not sure where to start?

People who say “I was too busy, I forgot to eat lunch”… I don’t get you. But maybe I’m the only weirdo who&nbsp;eats breakfast and then immediately starts counting down the hours ’til&nbsp;lunch? This bowl was inspired by one&nbsp;ordinary day last week when I made a quick lunch for myself with kale, sweet potatoes, some other things I had on hand, and these&nbsp;Yves Kale & Quinoa Bites. It’s definitely an “I work from home” kind of lunch, but the whole thing…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Happy early Valentine’s day… or Galentines Day… or whatever&nbsp;holiday you like to celebrate with heart-shaped treats and little paper cards. As I’ve written about many times before, Jack and I have this Chocolate Molten Cake Valentine’s tradition. This year I switched things up a bit and made this decadent yet mostly raw raspberry vegan cheesecake. How cute are those layers!? Vegan Cheesecake Recipe Variations I have two versions below – one version uses raw cashews for the white “cheesecake” layer and the other version uses vegan cream cheese.

When we first planted our lemon tree, I had this romantic idea that I’d be able to pick fresh lemons all year round. Obviously, I’m not good with plants, or I would have known that the famous saying is literally true. You get lemons once a year, and you get a lot of them. Needless to say, life has been lemony lately in many ways, but today it’s all about these lovely lemon shortbread cookies.

We actually celebrate most holidays early around here… at least food-wise. Christmas cookies in October, Thanksgiving food in late August and so on.&nbsp; I’m not sure what we’re doing for “real” Valentine’s yet – but once I got this recipe just right and the pictures were done, Jack and I sat down to a romantic (albeit reheated) meal for two.&nbsp;The only caveat – Jack doesn’t like beets. He’s not a picky eater but beets are on his short list of foods he usually won’t touch.

I know the Super Bowl is this Sunday but I have no clue who’s playing and if I had to guess (without googling it), I’d embarrass myself by naming teams from the wrong sport. But sportsball aside, here are a bunch of taco-nacho-ey-pizza-ish recipes that you might consider serving this weekend. I’d be game to eat any of these… game or no game. pictured above:&nbsp;Super Stuffed Chipotle Sweet Potatoes pictured above:&nbsp;Healthy Loaded Vegan Nachos Mango Goji Guacamole / Sweet Potato Avocado…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE POST >>>></a><p>Crazy weather we’ve been having here lately… one day we’re eating a sunny lunch on a&nbsp;patio and the next five nights we’re curled up at home trying to stay warm&nbsp;during torrential downpours.&nbsp;I SO wish I was one of those people who finds&nbsp;rainstorms to be cozy and calming, but I’m quite the opposite. Storms may get me a little edgy and nervous, but what does calm me down is making a stew like this one. This recipe comes from my friend Tess (a.k.a. The Blender Girl)’s new cookbook The Perfect Blend.&nbsp;This stew is everything you want on a cold January night…</p><a id=content-snippet-to-the-post class=to-the-recipe href=#>TO THE RECIPE >>>></a><p>Oh hi – long time no post. Last week, I was a bit sick and down for the count, to say the least.&nbsp;This week, I’m on a healing bender. I have my blender working overtime with&nbsp;crazy green smoothies made with ginger, turmeric and every herb that I’ve read about that contains immune-building qualities. I’m trying to eat lighter and brighter as well because I really do believe that plants can heal. Which brings me to this recipe from Blissful Basil, a cookbook that couldn’t have arrived at a better time.

Green smoothies, fresh bowls of vegetables, and hearty stews are all over social media. There’s not a cookie in sight and we don’t care because gorgeous healthy food is in abundance. For me, eating lighter doesn’t require juice cleanses or food fasts. I don’t like to feel hungry or deprived so instead I turn to&nbsp;recipes like these, a collection of my personal favorite&nbsp;plant-forward recipes that are both delicious and satisfying.
