Although this condition isn't easy to notice, you can tell that individuals suffer from it if their teeth appear longer than usual. Most people fail to notice gum recession because the process is gradual.<h2>Are gums supposed to be flat?</h2>Thick and flat gums<p>The consistency of the gum is thicker where it meets the tooth.
