According to their mother Karron, it was a formal adoption that gave the two boys dual citizenship without the requirement for marriage and improved their chances of becoming professional athletes.</p><h4 class=wp-block-heading><a href=#>READ ALSO: Chris Eubank Jr. Children: Does Chris Eubank Jr. Have Kids?</a></h4><p>In 2007, Eubank began his amateur career. He won his sixth amateur fight, making him the 165-pound weight division’s Amateur Golden Gloves Champion for the State of Nevada.</p><p>He won his ninth amateur fight, making him the Western States’ Amateur Golden Glove Champion for his weight class. In the 2008 National Golden Gloves, Eubank had a 1-1 record. He finished his amateur career with a 24-2 record.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Chris Eubank Jr career</h2><p>In 2011, Eubank signed a contract with promoter Mick Hennessy and became a professional. His father was his tutor, as was his father’s trainer Ronnie Davies. In the following three years, Eubank had an 18-0 record with 13 knockouts.</p><p>Eubank inked a contract to participate on BoxNation on February 19, 2014, and on February 22, he will fight for the first time at York Hall in London.

However, there was no altercation.</p><p>The possibility of a fight with Irish boxer Gary O’Sullivan on December 12, 2015, at London’s O2 Arena, on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dillian Whyte, has come up again. Since the two had a history of feuds and O’Sullivan had been specifically targeting Eubank on social media, the fight was eagerly anticipated.</p><p>The bout between Eubank and Blackwell (19-3-1, 8 KOs) was scheduled to take place on March 26 at London’s Wembley’s SSE Arena, according to a February 2016 announcement from Hennessy Sports. Channel 5 broadcast the battle in real time. Eubank had such a commanding advantage that his trainer, Chris Eubank Sr., started pleading with the referee to call time on the contest.</p><p>After re-signing with Matchroom Sport, it was revealed by Sky Sports on May 18, 2016, that Eubank would compete at The O2 on June 25, 2016, on the undercard of Anthony Joshua vs. Dominic Breazeale. On May 19, Tom Doran was named as Eubank Jr.’s rival.</p><p>On December 13, 2016, Eubank made a Facebook announcement announcing that he would be making his super-middleweight debut on ITV Box Office. On June 1, 2017, reports stated that Eubank would fight again in July in London to defend his IBO super middleweight title against former multiple-weight world champion Arthur Abraham (46-5, 30 KOs).</p><p>The World Boxing Super Series confirmed on July 7th, 2017 that the winner of the fight between Abraham and Eubank would compete in the super-middleweight knockout competition.

(16–0, 10 KOs).</p><p>Eubank and George Groves (27-3, 20 KOs), who each won their fights in October 2017, were slated to face off in the tournament’s semifinal. Initially, the fight’s promoter, Kalle Sauerland, said he would try to book it for a stadium in either Manchester or London.</p><p>Groves would perhaps be replaced by Eubank Jr. in the championship match versus Smith, according to Kalle Sauerland, who stated such on May 9. However, the match’s outcome will be confirmed in the following ten days.</p><p>As part of ITV’s new agreement with Haymon Sports’ Premier Boxing Champions, a press conference was held on January 3 to officially announce the James DeGale vs. Chris Eubank Jr. grudge bout, which would take place on February 23 at London’s O2 Arena and exclusively air on ITV Box Office.</p><p>For the vacant WBA interim middleweight title on December 7, 2019, Eubank Jr., ranked first by the WBA, took against Matt Korobov, a past title contender, who was ranked third by the WBA.</p><p>Following a break of nearly 17 months, Eubank Jr. made his comeback on May 1, 2021, to take against Marcus Morrison at the AO Arena in Manchester, England, with Roy Jones Jr. serving as his new trainer.

Given that the fathers of both boxers, Chris Eubank and Nigel Benn, maintained a fierce rivalry throughout the early to mid-’90s, which culminated in two fights: a TKO victory for Eubank during their first encounter in 1990 and a draw in their second encounter three years later, this fight has been promoted as a sort of grudge match.</p><p>On January 21, 2023, Eubank Jr. faced up against Liam Smith, a former WBO light-middleweight champion, in Manchester, England’s AO Arena. By TKO, Eubank was defeated in the fourth round.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who are Chris Eubank Jr’s parents?</h2><p>Eubank was born to the former professional boxer, Chris Eubank and Karron Suzanne Stephen-Martin.
