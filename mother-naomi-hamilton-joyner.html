When her family came together, and it was often, her home was full, loud, and had standing room only.&nbsp; She would ensure all who wanted to be part of the special event were there.&nbsp;&nbsp;Naomi&nbsp;would spend hours on the phone calling everyone to get the word out to come over.&nbsp; It was magical.&nbsp; Just the way she liked it.&nbsp; Her sisters and brothers from South Carolina, North Carolina and New York, often times would come on holidays and other special occasions.&nbsp;

(Mark 10:51).&nbsp;&nbsp;He saw the burden another carried and offered to help with the load.&nbsp; &nbsp;That was the spirit of&nbsp;Naomi!</p><p>Now this beautiful servant, can rest!&nbsp;&nbsp;Well done, thou good and faithful servant.&nbsp;&nbsp;You have finished the course&nbsp;and kept the faith!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Enter the gates of heaven where there is a place Jesus has prepared for you!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillam%2FsLzOpaCtmZ6bwq%2Bx0ZqjrJ2iq7aksY2cpqZnnZq6sL7ImqNopZ%2Bptaa%2BjKeYqKWZYrWiucilq6imXZ%2B8urrEq2Y%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmother-naomi-hamilton-joyner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./2-1-kg-to-lbs.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./2-1-kg-to-lbs.html>2.1 kg to lbs - 2.1 kilograms to pounds Conversion by NCESC</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./gerard-pique.html>Gerard Pique Biography, Facts &amp;amp;
