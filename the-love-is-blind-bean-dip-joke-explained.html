<time>21 May 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p data-characters=279 data-injectable=true data-video=true>Season 6 of <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love is Blind</a></strong> is as dramatic as ever, and things are only ramping up. The second portion of the season released on Feb. 21 to an eager audience, and saw as the couples shifted from the warm glow of their collective honeymoon into the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">harsh reality of the real world</a>.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Before they could even return to their regular lives, however, things were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">starting to take a turn</a>. In the sixth episode of the season, titled “Feeling Uncomfy,” what started as a joke quickly blossomed into jealousy and irritation, and led to arguments between several of the cast members.</p><p data-characters=276 data-current-count=579 data-injectable=true>It was all prompted by a pod joke between the girls which, once it spread to the guys, became a much bigger issue. Many viewers have likely never heard the term “bean dip” before, but any girl with locker room experience has plenty of background on the act itself.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-does-bean-dip-mean data-injectable=false>What does “bean dip” mean?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Love-is-Blind-bean-dip.jpg><p data-characters=393 data-current-count=693 data-injectable=true>The actual term used for the poorly delivered “joke” seen in episode 6 is unfamiliar to me, but once AD described it, I knew exactly what she was talking about. But first, some background. It’s clear that Laura introduced the other girls to the concept of “bean dip” <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">while in the pods</a>, and —&nbsp;among friendly women — it was nothing more than a funny quirk.</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>The idea behind Laura’s bean dip is simple: It’s just smacking another woman’s breast. Not hard, necessarily, but once up, and then from the side or top, in a quick double-hit reminiscent of a cat. Or… maybe someone grabbing bean dip? I’m not sure where the correlation lies.</p><p data-characters=292 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Regardless, anyone who participated in a sport or grew up with older sisters has likely had her knockers knocked around once or twice, and — for those okay with it — its a funny, if occasionally painful, exchange. Once men get in on it, however, the lighthearted humor tends to disappear.</p><p data-characters=462 data-current-count=462 data-injectable=true>That’s where <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the problem arose on Love is Blind</a>. Laura had clearly educated the other women on “bean dip” ahead of their honeymoons, and at some point she clued her fiancé, Jeramey, in on the joke. That’s all well and good, but where Laura slipped up was in encouraging Jeramey to give AD a good bean dipping. That would have been hugely inappropriate, particularly during both of their honeymoons, and thankfully, Jeramey realized that.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=352 data-injectable=false>What he didn’t realize, however, was that he would still cause problems by bringing it up. He mentioned Laura’s request to AD and her fiancé, clearly intending it as a joke, but Clay was not pleased at the thought. He mentioned to Laura that, while AD was not offended, he was, and the resulting argument soured the events of the evening.</p><p data-characters=352 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>At the end of the day, the “bean dip” joke is silly, immature, and relatively harmless, but it’s easy to see how bringing it up in that environment went poorly. Ladies, its probably fine if you’d like to try the move — with consent — on your female friends, but maybe don’t make things awkward by bringing it up in public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Laura’s response to the “bean dip” fallout</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Bean-dip-Laura.jpg><p data-characters=349 data-current-count=649 data-injectable=true>The entire bean dip incident largely faded into the background of Love is Blind season 6 by the latter half of the season, but Laura did address the backlash it spurred during her appearance at the reunion. At the tail end of her cameo in the reunion, Laura took time to apologize to both AD and Clay for being part of the issue in the first place.</p><p data-characters=379 data-current-count=379 data-injectable=false>Admitting to being a “goofball,” Laura notes that she meant “no disrespect” with the joke, and emphasized how sorry she was to have shown any disrespect to AD. Highlighting that she loves both AD and Clay to bits, Laura polished off her apology by stating that “it was a joke that was just taken completely out of context and I’m sorry.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsGnuMixZq2glWK5sMLEZqCsZZKhtq%2BwjJucmqZdmbaxecmoop5lla29ra3Ip5ydZw%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-love-is-blind-bean-dip-joke-explained.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./anne-gearan.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./anne-gearan.html>White house correspondent, Anne Gearan is a married woman and a mother of one daughter.</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./moody-ability.html>Moody (Ability) - Bulbapedia, the community-driven Pokmon encyclopedia</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./moody-ability.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
