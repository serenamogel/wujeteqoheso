After he was suspected in the 1957 murder of Bernice Worden in Plainfield, Wisconsin, the investigation of Gein’s home led to the gruesome discovery that he collected human organs and fashioned clothing and accessories out of body parts. He was eventually convicted of Worden’s murder and spent the rest of his life institutionalized. In 1984, Gein died of complications from lung cancer at age 77. His crimes helped inspire fictional killers in popular movies—including Psycho’s Norman Bates, The Silence of the Lambs’s Buffalo Bill, and The Texas Chain Saw Massacre’s Leatherface—and earned Gein nicknames such as the “Butcher of Plainfield” and the “Plainfield Ghoul.”</p><h2 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Edward Theodore Gein<br>BORN: August 27, 1906<br>DIED: July 26, 1984<br>BIRTHPLACE: La Crosse, Wisconsin<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Virgo</p><h2 title="Upbringing and Family Deaths " data-anchor-id=upbringing-and-family-deaths class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Upbringing and Family Deaths</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Edward Theodore Gein was born on August 27, 1906, in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The son of George, a timid alcoholic father, and Augusta, a fanatically religious mother, Ed grew up alongside his older brother, Henry, in a household ruled by his mother’s puritanical preachings about the sins of lust and carnal desire.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Around 1915, Augusta moved the family to a farm outside Plainfield, Wisconsin. Ed rarely left the farm, except for attending school.</p><img alt="a house sits in a snow covered field with trees on either side" title="Ed Gein's House" width=3949 height=2845 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/home-of-serial-killer-ed-gein-in-plainfield-in-wisconsin-in-news-photo-1701107084.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>The Gein house in Plainfield, Wisconsin</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After George died in 1940, Ed and Henry began working more odd jobs to support the family. In 1944, the brothers were burning brush on the property, when the fire raged out of control. Henry was found dead, and although it was initially believed to be the result of the fire, the circumstances surrounding his death, as well as Ed’s later activities, led to conjecture that the younger brother might have been responsible.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Obsessively devoted to his mother, Gein never left home or dated women. However, after she died in late 1945, he became increasingly deranged. Now living alone, he left her room neat and untouched while the rest of the home fell into squalor. He also developed an interest in anatomy books.</p><h2 title=Victims data-anchor-id=victims class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Victims</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein managed to support himself as a handyman and—despite his odd behavior—as a babysitter. Meanwhile, a few residents from the area had mysteriously disappeared over the years. Among them was Mary Hogan, who ran a tavern in nearby Pine Grove that Gein regularly frequented. The 54-year-old woman disappeared in December 1954.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">On November 16, 1957, Bernice Worden, 58, was reported missing from her hardware store in Plainfield. The cash register was also gone, and a trail of blood led out the back. Her son Frank, a deputy sheriff, was suspicious of Gein, and the reclusive man was soon apprehended at a neighbor’s house.</p><img alt="a policeman sitting amid a kitchen with cluttered items" title="Policeman searching the littered kitchen of Ed Gein" width=3136 height=2315 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unidentified-police-officer-examines-the-junk-littered-news-photo-1700081862.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>A police officer investigates the cluttered kitchen of Ed Gein following his arrest.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The authorities sent to Gein’s home that night were greeted by the gruesome sight of Worden’s headless, gutted body hanging from the ceiling. Her head was soon found in a sack and her heart hanging in a plastic bag. Further investigation yielded more shocking discoveries, including organs in jars, skulls used as soup bowls, and a belt made from human nipples.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Under questioning, 51-year-old Gein confessed to killing Worden, as well as Hogan three years earlier. He shot both women, who resembled his late mother. Additionally, he admitted to digging up numerous corpses in order to cut off body parts, practice necrophilia, and fashion masks and suits out of skin to wear around the home. With that sort of evidence, authorities attempted to connect him to other recent murders and disappearances but were unable to draw any definitive conclusions.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Notorious Killers</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In March 1958, the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.newspapers.com/article/stevens-point-journal-ed-gein-house-de/23042150/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Stevens Point Journal reported" data-vars-ga-product-id=d0265700-0f54-41aa-adfc-814e07781f51 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.newspapers.com/article/stevens-point-journal-ed-gein-house-de/23042150/ data-product-url=https://www.newspapers.com/article/stevens-point-journal-ed-gein-house-de/23042150/ data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=74968X1712615&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newspapers.com%2Farticle%2Fstevens-point-journal-ed-gein-house-de%2F23042150%2F" data-affiliate-network={} data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=6f1ef0b0-2dbb-40ba-b428-408f548a40c0 class="body-link product-links css-9bav67 e1rq56bv0">Stevens Point Journal reported</a> that Gein’s farmhouse had burned down amid rumors the site might be turned into a museum.

He was committed to Central State Hospital in Waupun, Wisconsin, where he variously worked as a mason, carpenter’s assistant, and medical center aide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In early 1968, Gein was determined fit to finally stand trial. That November, he was found guilty of Worden’s murder. However, he was also found insane at the time of the murder, and as such, he was recommitted to Central State Hospital. Save for his attempt to petition for a release in 1974, which was rejected, the mild-mannered Gein made virtually no news while institutionalized.</p><h2 title=Death data-anchor-id=death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the late 1970s with his health failing, Gein was transferred to the Mendota Mental Health Institute in Madison, Wisconsin. He died of complications from lung cancer and respiratory illnesses on July 26, 1984, at age 77.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein was buried in a county cemetery near Plainfield, and his grave became something of a tourist attraction. Some visitors even chipped off pieces of his gravestone to keep as souvenirs. Then, in June 2000, the entire gravestone was stolen. The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://nypost.com/2000/06/22/devil-diggers-rip-off-psycho-killers-grave/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="New York Post reported" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">New York Post reported</a> that Waushara County police initially believed occult groups might have been behind the theft.

The best known is the “Butcher of Plainfield,” a reference to both his hometown and his inclination to dismember victims. It was used as the subtitle in a 2007 made-for-video film, Ed Gein: The Butcher of Plainfield.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein has also been referred to as the “Plainfield Ghoul” and the “Grandfather of Gore.”</p><h2 title="Movies Gein Inspired: Psycho, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and More" data-anchor-id=movies-gein-inspired-psycho-the-texas-chain-saw-massacre-and-more class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Movies Gein Inspired: Psycho, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, and More</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The story of Gein’s gruesome activities, particularly his devotion to a dead mother, strongly influenced Robert Bloch’s 1959 novel <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Novel-Robert-Bloch/dp/1590203356 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Psycho data-vars-ga-product-id=a10af235-21c3-4283-bec7-b28378e949aa data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Novel-Robert-Bloch/dp/1590203356 data-product-url=https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Novel-Robert-Bloch/dp/1590203356 data-affiliate=true data-affiliate-url=https://www.amazon.com/Psycho-Novel-Robert-Bloch/dp/1590203356 data-affiliate-network='{"id":"c754abb3-3204-4f94-a191-fe83f09385e4","site_id":"73ce8f33-abd8-4d76-b5c7-1c72caf717ce","metadata":{},"network":{"id":"469ce69f-4798-416d-9432-eaa9954b4053","name":"Amazon","metadata":{}}}' data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=73f866e1-22ab-4112-8c43-4bb405b376d8 class="body-link product-links css-9bav67 e1rq56bv0">Psycho</a>, which was adapted to the big screen the following year by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/movies-tv/alfred-hitchcock data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Alfred Hitchcock" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Alfred Hitchcock</a> and starred <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/janet-leigh data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Janet Leigh" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Janet Leigh</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/anthony-perkins data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Anthony Perkins" class="body-link css-9bav67 e1k3dme10">Anthony Perkins</a> as the unstable Norman Bates.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Gein at least partially inspired other notorious movie villains, including Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (1974) and Buffalo Bill in The Silence of the Lambs (1991).

I just knew about something that happened that was horrendous.

Clark’s family eventually contacted members of the production crew about their existence. “I had always assumed that Ed Gein was this meek, mild person, and that really comes through in the tapes,” Day said. “But when you hear his voice and you hear that interaction between him and the authorities, it really sets him apart from the serial killer myth, this kind of handsome, Anthony Perkins type who can talk his way out of anything. Ed Gein is the opposite of that. But that’s what I think is so scary about him. He really is a monster in plain sight.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to the tapes, the series used archival police photos to illustrate the gory extent of Gein’s crimes.</p>Fact Check: We strive for accuracy and fairness.
