We were touched by Cyrus’s bighearted love of Blair, and by Dan and Serena’s endless, adolescent struggles with How They Feel. And, of course, we were especially moved by the ever-evolving relationship between Chuck and Blair. Readers, we’ll confess to you and only you: When Chuck at last succumbed to Blair’s cuddle, tears streaking down his odd funny-shaped face, we were&nbsp;so&nbsp;moved that before we knew it we were misting up a little, and there was snot, and we had to get off the treadmill and hobble out of the gym to watch the rest of the show in the privacy of our own homes. Not that it helped much. Everyone at the gym knew what we were sobbing about; they were watching it on their little screens,&nbsp;too.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzepc000023d5u45q2mmpv@published data-word-count=52>But after we got home, we entered the angry stage, because everything seemed to be falling apart. Chuck spurned Blair — again. Serena and Dan parted ways — again. And Rufus and Lily appeared headed for the skids — again, but not before Rufus dropped his giant&nbsp;WTF&nbsp;in the middle of Grand Central&nbsp;Station.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeppq000a3d5uefs4k2e9@published data-word-count=10>“Just tell me one thing.

The other involves back-patting.&nbsp;<strong>Plus 5</strong>, with an additional&nbsp;<strong>Plus 1</strong>&nbsp;for the gratuitous finger-squeeze she throws into her hug with&nbsp;Dan.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeq0g000l3d5ulvnbtbit@published data-word-count=36>• Ed Westwick’s performance of an angry, drunk, broken Chuck is a tour de force.&nbsp;<strong>Plus 3</strong>, for the way he manages to keep one eye closed the entire episode and even, at the end, turn entirely&nbsp;yellow.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzepvd000g3d5uzuxwxgx1@published data-word-count=22>• While trying to sober Chuck up, Blair inadvertently reveals how good she is at the art of purging.

My family is a disaster. My brother is lonely, my mother is losing it, and Chuck has publicly disowned our family.” And Aaron goes, “Are you sure there’s not something else?” Um, other than all those&nbsp;totally solid reasons she just stated? “That’s why he’s a douche,” Jessica’s husband said, sagely.&nbsp;<strong>Plus&nbsp;5</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer2v00193d5uwj0mj7g9@published data-word-count=17>• “Only a masochist could ever love such a narcissist,” says Blair, who then asks for hugs.&nbsp;<strong>Plus&nbsp;3</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqcq000u3d5uyu20w9zx@published data-word-count=21>• Serena, regarding the Waldorf’s wedding chuppah, “It’s beautiful,” she says. “And so are you,” says Aaron Rose.

Also, what does Serena need a rock for? She barely knew Bart and didn’t like him.&nbsp;<strong>Minus only 1</strong>, because we may be thirtysomethings, but obviously we know what rock she&nbsp;wants.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqv400133d5u4tayi1c6@published data-word-count=27>•l What kind of cheesy, Hypnotiq-grade club liquor did Chuck steal from the bar before the funeral?

Everyone knows Step One is “piggyback rides.”&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;2</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqy100153d5uucabg80f@published data-word-count=85>• So, timing in this episode is all messed up. Lily and Rufus make plans to go away to a B&B together&nbsp;the night after the funeral? If Bart Bass’s death is big enough to “rock the city,” then “Page Six” would be all over that, and Lily — even the new, openly Rufus-obsessed Lily — is way too image-conscious to allow that. Also, Aaron’s invitation to take Serena to Argentina is effective&nbsp;immediately? That was super convenient of Bart, to die over Christmas vacation like that.&nbsp;<strong>Minus&nbsp;3</strong>.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzeqzw00173d5uuiglc7je@published data-word-count=65>• We’re confused. We’re told Bart Bass died in a car accident on the way to meet Lily, but when last we saw him, he was in the car on the way to meet Lily, with private detective Andrew Tyler. Did he switch cars? How did Andrew Tyler get away without a scratch?&nbsp;<strong>Minus 20</strong>, because we should have some exposition other than “there was an&nbsp;accident.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzerat001g3d5uxnoeanbi@published data-word-count=93>• “I was thinking something in a jacket, very&nbsp;YSL,” Eleanor suggests for her wedding outfit. “Mick and Bianca, 1971, great reference,” Jenny comes up and says in the most patronizing way possible, especially since Bianca Jagger’s wedding blazer showed enormous, unsupported cleavage and Eleanor clearly wants to wear one because she’s old and saggy and doesn’t want to show her shoulders.&nbsp;<strong>Minus 4</strong>&nbsp;because Eleanor would have remembered all too well how Jenny screwed her by running off with her marquee dress. And also&nbsp;<strong>Minus 4</strong>&nbsp;because Jenny, ugh, put some bottoms on, you’re at a funeral&nbsp;reception.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/cj7lzer2u00183d5ui0vovzrz@published data-word-count=32>• “If you’re looking for Bart’s will, you don’t have to worry,” Lilly says. What does that mean, exactly?
