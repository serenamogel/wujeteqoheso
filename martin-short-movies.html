In recognition of his outstanding contributions, Short was honored as an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2019, a testament to his enduring impact on the Canadian and international entertainment scenes.</p><p>Short’s journey into the world of entertainment took a unique turn. Initially, upon graduating from McMaster University, he had aspirations of pursuing a career in social work. However, fate had other plans for him when he landed a role in the 1972 Toronto production of “Godspell.”</p><p>This production proved to be a pivotal moment in his life, as it ignited his passion for acting. Notably, the cast of this production included future luminaries like Victor Garber, Gilda Radner, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, and Andrea Martin, with Paul Shaffer serving as the musical director. Short revealed in the documentary “Love, Gilda” that he and Gilda Radner shared an on-and-off romantic relationship during this time.</p><p>Following his debut, Martin Short’s career in the entertainment industry began to take shape. He appeared in various television shows and theatrical productions, including the drama “Fortune and Men’s Eyes” in 1972.

The following year, Short joined the cast of “I’m a Big Girl Now,” a sitcom featuring Diana Canova and Danny Thomas. Interestingly, Canova was selected for the role due to her success in playing Corinne Tate Flotsky on ABC’s “Soap,” and she left “Soap” shortly before Short’s wife, Nancy Dolman, joined the show.</p><p>Throughout his career, Short ventured into voice acting, lending his distinctive voice to various projects. He notably voiced the iconic character, the Cat in the Hat, in the animated TV series “The Cat in the Hat Knows a Lot About That!” from 2010 to 2013.

He joined the cast of “How I Met Your Mother” for its seventh season in 2011, portraying Marshall’s energetic boss. Additionally, he served as a judge on the first season of “Canada’s Got Talent” in 2012.</p><p>A memorable moment in Martin Short’s career came when he, along with Steve Martin and Chevy Chase, graced an episode of “Saturday Night Live” as part of the “Five-Timers Club” on March 9, 2013. Notably, Short appeared in the role of a waiter during this appearance, as he had hosted the show three times at that point.</p><p>Continuing to captivate audiences, Short embarked on a series of one-man shows, delighting audiences with his beloved characters and sketches. These shows bore titles like “Fame Becomes Me,” “Stroke Me Lady Fame,” “If I’d Saved, I Wouldn’t Be Here,” and “Sunday in the Park with George Michael.” His memoir, “I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend,” was published on November 4, 2014, offering a glimpse into his remarkable 40-year journey in show business.</p><p>From 2014 to 2015, Martin Short took on the role of Lou Cannon in the Fox sitcom “Mulaney.” He played the boss and game show host of the title character, John Mulaney. In 2015, he returned to Broadway, stepping into the shoes of Nathan Lane in the Terrence McNally comedic play “It’s Only a Play.”</p><p>May 31, 2016, marked the debut of Martin Short’s new variety show on NBC, titled “Maya & Marty.” This entertaining show also featured the talented Maya Rudolph. Simultaneously, Short began touring alongside fellow comedian Steve Martin. Their collaborative tours included memorable titles like “A Very Stupid Conversation” in 2015, “An Evening You Will Forget for the Rest of Your Life” in 2017, and “The Funniest Show in Town at the Moment” in 2021. Notably, their 2017 tour was filmed for Netflix as a special and received four Primetime Emmy Award nominations, along with a Directors Guild of America Award nomination.</p><p>From 2019 to 2021, Short showcased his comedic prowess by portraying Dick Lundry in the Apple TV+ series “The Morning Show.” Additionally, he brought his unique charm to another Apple TV+ series, “Schmigadoon!,” where he appeared as a Leprechaun from 2021 onwards.</p><p>Short’s vocal talents extended to the big screen as he voiced Grandpa Frump in “The Addams Family” (2019) and Father Willoughby in the Netflix animated film “The Willoughbys” (2020), adding his signature humor to these characters. In a delightful reunion, he reprised the role of Franck Eggelhoffer in the Nancy Meyers directed short film “Father of the Bride Part 3(ish)” in 2020.</p><p>One of Short’s recent endeavors is the Hulu comedy series “Only Murders in the Building.” In this series, he not only stars but also serves as an executive producer alongside Steve Martin and Selena Gomez. The show received a nomination for a 2021 Peabody Award, and Short earned his 13th Emmy nomination in July 2022 for his role in “Only Murders in the Building.” His nominations encompassed the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Comedy Series and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series, showcasing his enduring appeal and comedic prowess.</p><p>Martin Short’s illustrious career has spanned decades, captivating audiences across various mediums, from stage to screen.
