Manafort Jr. served as one of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald J.

Prior to this Manafort had earned a reputation as a political consultant who offered his lobbying skills to clients around the globe, some of whom were among the world's most corrupt rulers. In October 2017, a federal grand jury indicted Manafort on 12 counts, including money laundering and conspiracy against the United States — a result from the investigation of special counsel <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/robert-mueller data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Robert Mueller" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Robert Mueller</a>. Following an August 2018 trial, in which he was convicted on eight counts of bank and tax fraud, and an attempted plea deal, he was sentenced to 7 1/2 years behind bars.</p><h2 data-node-id=3 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Paul John Manafort Jr. was born in New Britain, Connecticut on April 1, 1949. Manafort grew up in New Britain, where his father, Paul J. Manafort Sr., served three terms as mayor. He attended St. Thomas Aquinas High School.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1971, Manafort graduated with a degree in business administration from Georgetown University; he received his law degree from the same school in 1974.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Beginning a Career in Politics</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During the 1976 Republican National Convention, President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/gerald-ford data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Gerald Ford" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Gerald Ford</a> was facing a challenge from Ronald Reagan. Manafort corralled delegates to make sure the incumbent president remained his party's nominee (Ford would lose the general election to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/jimmy-carter data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jimmy Carter" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Jimmy Carter</a>).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort also worked on Ronald Reagan's successful 1980 presidential campaign. That same year he helped found the lobbying firm Black, Manafort & Stone, partnering with Roger Stone.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Political Consultant and Lobbyist</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort lobbied for clients from around the world, including regimes in the Philippines, Kenya and Nigeria. Many of those he served had demonstrated little respect for human rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 1995, Manafort and Rick Davis started the firm Davis Manafort, which also provided lobbying services. In addition, Manafort remained connected to U.S. politics, working for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/george-hw-bush data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="George H.W. Bush" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">George H.W. Bush</a> and Bob Dole's presidential campaigns.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort registered the firm DMP International in 2011. This is the firm that, between 2012 and 2014, received more than $17 million for work in the Ukraine.</p><img alt="Paul Manafort Photo" title="Paul Manafort Photo" width=4000 height=2667 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-870910522.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images</span><p>Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for Donald Trump, walks out of the U.S. Courthouse after a bond hearing in Washington, D.C., on Monday, Nov. 6, 2017.</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Manafort and Russia</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2006, Manafort signed a $10 million-per-year contract with Oleg Deripaska, a Russian oligarch with close ties to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/vladimir-putin data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Vladimir Putin" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Vladimir Putin</a>. With Rick Gates, Manafort started Pericles, a private equity fund, in 2006; Deripaska became an investor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In 2014, Deripaska filed a petition alleging Manafort owed him millions from an investment, a claim that seems to have been put aside by late 2015. A report by NBC News in October 2017 stated that Deripaska's known business dealings with Manafort added up to approximately $60 million.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The Washington Post reported in September 2017 that while Manafort was working on the Trump campaign he reached out, via an intermediary, to offer Deripaska "private briefings" on the presidential race. There is no evidence such briefings occurred.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Work in Ukraine</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort began to work for Ukraine's Viktor Yanukovych and his Party of Regions after questions of electoral fraud (and the poisoning of an opponent) led to the country's highest court annulling a Yanukovych victory in the 2004 Ukrainian presidential election. Manafort guided the politician through an image makeover; critics also say the consultant went along with campaign tactics that exacerbated the divide between the country's Russian and Ukrainian speakers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yanukovych won the presidency in 2010; this time he successfully took office. But his pro-Russian stance — he decided not to sign a European Union pact in November 2013 — led to massive protests against him. In February 2014, Yanukovych fled to Russia. Manafort continued to offer counsel to Yanukovych's former political party, which renamed itself the Opposition Bloc.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The foreign agent paperwork that Manafort filed in 2017 showed that from 2012 to 2014 his firm received more than $17 million from Ukraine clients. Manafort also brought in other lobbying firms, including the Podesta Group, via a think tank in Belgium.</p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Trump Campaign Manager</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March 2016, Manafort became an adviser to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/donald-trump data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Donald Trump</a>'s presidential campaign. At the time Trump was facing possible delegate defections at the national convention; as Manafort had forestalled a similar challenge in 1976 by wrangling delegates, his skills were appreciated. Manafort became manager of the campaign in June, putting him in charge during the Republican National Convention in July.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort offered his services for free, which was unusual for him. Though he'd been introduced to Trump by mutual acquaintance Roy Cohn in 1979 or 1980, and had purchased a condominium in New York City's Trump Tower in 2006, Manafort wasn't close to the candidate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On June 9, Manafort, along with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/jared-kushner data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Jared Kushner" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Jared Kushner</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/history-culture/donald-trump-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Donald Trump Jr" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Donald Trump Jr</a>., met with a Russian lawyer who supposedly had negative information to share about <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/hillary-clinton data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hillary Clinton" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Hillary Clinton</a>, the Democratic presidential nominee. Manafort later gave investigators notes he'd taken on a smartphone during the meeting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">An article about an alleged $12 million in illegal payments made to Manafort during his time in Ukraine was published by the New York Times in August (Manafort denied these payments; in 2017 Ukrainian prosecutors would state they had no proof of them). On August 19, 2016, Manafort left the campaign.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Indictments</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On October 30, 2017, Manafort surrendered to the FBI to face a 12-count indictment. The charges included conspiracy, failing to register as a foreign agent, not reporting foreign income and making false statements. Manafort was also accused of laundering $18 million. In court he pleaded not guilty to the charges and was released on house arrest with a $10 million bond.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The charges were assembled by special counsel Robert Mueller and his team. Mueller's focus was on Russian interference into the 2016 election, but his office also took over earlier investigations of Manafort (so as not to have overlapping federal inquiries). The charges largely stem from events before the campaign, though Manafort had not registered his prior work as a foreign agent while spearheading Trump's election efforts (in 2017, Manafort belatedly submitted this paperwork).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">FBI agents with a no-knock warrant searched Manafort's house in Virginia on the morning of July 26, 2017. They were looking for tax documents and records from foreign banks.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On January 3, 2018, Manafort filed a lawsuit against Mueller and the Justice Department, saying prosecutors had overstepped their bounds by investigating "decade-old business dealings" and charging him for conduct unrelated to Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort's legal problems deepened when Mueller unsealed a new, 32-count indictment in late February that charged the former Trump adviser with lying to banks to secure millions of dollars in loans as part of a long-running money laundering scheme, with help from his business associate Rick Gates. Many of the charges were similar to those from the October 2017 indictment, although the new one outlined additional criminal behavior.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In March, a U.S. district judge assigned to the indictment declared that Manafort posed "a substantial risk of flight" and ordered him confined to house arrest, save for medical appointments, court appearances and meetings with his defense attorneys. "Given the nature of the charges against the defendant and the apparent weight of the evidence against him, defendant faces the very real possibility of spending the rest of his life in prison," wrote the judge.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In early June, prosecutors filed a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, saying they had probable cause to believe that Manafort attempted to tamper with potential witnesses while on pretrial release. According to the filing, Manafort and an associate, a Russian citizen named Konstantin Kilimnik, attempted to repeatedly contact two witnesses to "secure materially false testimony." However, one of the witnesses blew a hole in their covert attempts by submitting saved text messages to the government.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Days later, Manafort was indicted on new charges of conspiring to obstruct justice, prompting a federal judge to revoke his bail and send him to jail to await his July 2018 trial. The news drew a sharp response from President Trump, who cited Manafort's work for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/ronald-reagan data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ronald Reagan" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Ronald Reagan</a> and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/bob-dole data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Bob Dole" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Bob Dole</a> while calling the judge's order "very unfair."</p><h2 data-node-id=40 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Trial and Conviction</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort's first trial, in which he faced 18 charges of financial fraud, began on July 31, 2018, in Alexandria, Virginia. Calling him a man who "believed the law did not apply to him," prosecutor Uzo Asonye described Manafort's efforts to conceal earnings from his consultancy work in Ukraine and his method of lying to banks on loan applications, while flouting the system by purchasing a $2 million home and a $15,000 ostrich coat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=42 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The defense countered by shifting blame for wrongdoing to Gates, arguing that Manafort was unaware of the illicit activities orchestrated by his associate and only guilty of placing his trust in the wrong person. Gates subsequently took the stand for three days, during which time he recalled the process of setting up overseas shell companies and forging documents to procure loans for his boss.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After Manafort's lawyers rested without calling any witnesses, the jury began lengthy deliberations on August 16, emerging only to ask Judge T.S. Ellis to define "reasonable doubt." On the morning of August 21, the jury sent out a note asking what to do when unable to reach a consensus on one of the counts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=44 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Later that afternoon, Manafort was found guilty of eight of the 18 counts — five charges of tax fraud, one charge of hiding foreign bank accounts and two charges of bank fraud. Judge Ellis declared a mistrial on the other 10 counts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=45 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort stood to receive a maximum of 80 years in prison for the conviction. The judge did not immediately set a sentencing date, noting he would give prosecutors eight days to decide whether to retry the defendant on the undecided counts.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=46 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Prior to the start of his second trial in Washington, D.C., it was reported that Manafort had explored the possibility of a plea deal, though those discussions stalled over issues raised by the special counsel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On September 14, 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy against the U.S. and one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice due to attempts to tamper with witnesses. Prosecutor Andrew Weissmann told the judge that Manafort's plea agreement was a "cooperation agreement" and the remaining charges will be dropped at the sentencing "or at the agreement of successful cooperation."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=48 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">However, Mueller's office later filed a court order that accused Manafort of repeatedly and deliberately giving false statements after agreeing to cooperate. Despite his attorneys' arguments that the alleged lies were unintentional, a federal judge sided with the prosecutors and ruled in February 2019 that they were no longer bound to terms of the plea deal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">On March 7, 2019, Manafort was sentenced to 47 months in prison by Judge Ellis, a far lighter sentence than the 19-to-24-year term sought by prosecutors for his financial crimes. On March 13 he received an additional sentence of 43 months for the federal conspiracy charges.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=50 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Shortly after the announcement of his second sentence, Manafort was charged in New York with a series of state felonies that included mortgage fraud, conspiracy and falsifying business records. Those charges were ultimately dismissed by a New York judge toward the end of the year.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=51 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In May 2020, it was reported that Manafort had been released from a federal correctional institution in Pennsylvania and would be serving the remainder of his sentence in home confinement due to concerns about the coronavirus pandemic.</p><h2 data-node-id=52 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Wife and Daughters</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=53 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Manafort is married to Kathleen, a 1979 graduate of George Washington University who received her law degree from Georgetown in 1988. The couple has two daughters: Jessica (born in 1982) and Andrea (born in 1985).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Jessica filed for divorce from husband Jeffrey Yohai in March 2017, but before that Manafort had spent millions to support some of his son-in-law's real estate deals.</p><ul data-node-id=57 class="css-aklha1 emevuu60"><li>Birth Year: 1949</li><li>Birth date: April 1, 1949</li><li>Birth State: Connecticut</li><li>Birth City: New Britain</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Paul Manafort is a political consultant who served as a campaign manager of presidential candidate Donald Trump in 2016.
