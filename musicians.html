Forging a link between soul and pop, he had a diverse repertoire that attracted both black and white audiences, and started his own record label and publishing company. Cooke died on December 11, 1964, in Los Angeles, California.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Sometimes called the father of soul music, singer Sam Cooke first reached the top of the charts in 1957 with "You Send Me." A string of pop and R&B hits soon followed, but he actually started out as a gospel performer. Born Samuel Cook in Clarksdale, Mississippi, he grew up in Chicago as the son of a minister.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Cooke began performing with his family as a child. In his teens, he formed a quintet called the Highway QCs. Cooke modeled his early work after one of his greatest inspirations, the Soul Stirrers, a popular gospel group. Not long after graduating from high school in 1948, he got the chance of a lifetime: being asked to join the Soul Stirrers, which provided him with an opportunity to hone his craft.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Career Highlights</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After six years with the Soul Stirrers, Cooke began to branch out into secular music. He recorded his first single, 1957's "Lovable," under the pseudonym "Dale Cooke." Later that year, Cooke released his first number one hit, "You Send Me." Music fans loved this ballad so much that it toppled Elvis' "Jailhouse Rock" from the top of the charts. Before long he put his crystal-clear, velvet-smooth voice to work on such up-tempo tunes as "Only Sixteen" and "Everybody Loves To Cha Cha Cha."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to being a talented singer and songwriter, Cooke had business smarts. He established his own publishing company for his music in 1959 and negotiated an impressive contract with RCA in 1960. Not only did he get a substantial advance, but Cooke would also get ownership of his master recordings after 30 years. Getting this was a remarkable feat for any recording artist at the time. He continued to be a pioneer behind the scenes, founding his own record label in the early 1960s. Working with other artists on his label, Cooke helped develop the careers of Bobby Womack and Billy Preston, among others.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">More hits followed Cooke's move to RCA, including 1960's "Chain Gang." Behind the song's catchy rhythm mimicking the sound of prisoners breaking rocks, the song also served as a social commentary by Cooke. He continued to win over fans with a variety of musical styles, from the 1960 ballad "Wonderful World" to the 1962 dance track "Twistin' the Night Away." In 1963, Cooke once again charted with his ode to loneliness, "Another Saturday Night."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Tragic Death and Legacy</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">No one knows for certain what exactly happened in the early hours of December 11, 1964. Cooke had been out the night before, reportedly drinking at a Los Angeles bar where he met a woman named Elisa Boyer. The pair hit it off and eventually ended up at the Hacienda Motel. There the couple had some type of altercation in their room, and Cooke then ended up in the motel's office. He reportedly clashed with the motel's manager, and the manager shot Cooke. Cooke died from his injury, which the manager claimed was inflicted in self-defense. It was later ruled justifiable homicide.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Thousands turned out to mourn the legendary singer. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/ray-charles data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Ray Charles" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Ray Charles</a> and Lou Rawls sang at his funeral in Los Angeles, and another service was held in his former hometown, Chicago. The year after his death, Cooke's record company released his song "A Change Is Gonna Come." He wrote this civil rights anthem in response to Bob Dylan's "Blowin' in the Wind." It was perhaps his most pointedly political song.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">No matter the circumstances of his passing, Cooke left behind a tremendous musical legacy. It only takes a listen to recordings of his live shows, such as his 1963 performance at Miami's Harlem Square Club, to recognize his contributions to soul music. And as a pop icon, Cooke has endured through his songs. <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musician/otis-redding data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Otis Redding" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Otis Redding</a> and Al Green are among the artists who have covered his work. He was inducted into the Rock and Rock Hall of Fame in 1986.</p><ul data-node-id=20 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Name: Sam Cooke</li><li>Birth Year: 1931</li><li>Birth date: January 22, 1931</li><li>Birth State: Mississippi</li><li>Birth City: Clarksdale</li><li>Birth Country: United States</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Sam Cooke was a trailblazing recording artist who helped shape the soul and pop scene with hits like "You Send Me," "Chain Gang" and "Sad Mood."</li><li>Industries</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Civil Rights</li><li>Pop</li><li>Rock</li></ul><li>Astrological Sign: Aquarius</li><li>Death Year: 1964</li><li>Death date: December 11, 1964</li><li>Death State: California</li><li>Death City: Los Angeles</li><li>Death Country: United States</li></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/page/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><ul data-node-id=25 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: Sam Cooke Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/musician/sam-cooke</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: October 28, 2021</li><li>Original Published Date: April 2, 2014</li></ul><span class="css-1s9owpq e17dn9hs1"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/b50d4909-0f39-4b73-b482-46d0a9078d40_1682363012.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Biography.com Editors" title="Headshot of Biography.com Editors" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>The Biography.com staff is a team of people-obsessed and news-hungry editors with decades of collective experience.
