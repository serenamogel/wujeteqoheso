<time>19 Jan 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Johnathan Kovacevic attributes his success to his parents for instilling in him a positive outlook. The Montreal Canadiens defenseman Johnathan is the son of his&nbsp;</span>Montenegrian&nbsp;father Novica and his Bosnian&nbsp;mother Angie.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Novica was a software engineer, and Angie was an IV nurse at a premier Ontario hospital. In addition, Kovacevic also enrolled in civil engineering since he believed he needed to be ready in case hockey didn’t work out.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>After a chat with Jets scout Max Giese midway through the 2016–17 season, he began considering a career in the NHL.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Winnipeg Jets</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;selected him in the third round, 74th overall, in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. On March 17, 2019, Kovacevic sealed a two-year entry-level deal with the Jets after three seasons at Merrimack College.</span></p><h2 id=johnathan-kovacevic-parents-novica-and-angie><span class=ez-toc-section id=johnathan-kovacevic-parents-novica-and-angie-met-in-the-summer-of-1991></span> Johnathan Kovacevic Parents Novica And Angie Met In The Summer Of 1991<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Ice hockey defenseman Johnathan Kovacevic was raised by his parents, Novica and Angie, in Ontario, Canada. Meanwhile, they first met in the summer of 1991, only a few months after Novica moved to Canada.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>A familiar acquaintance in Hamilton’s Serbian community initially attempted to set them up during a group picnic. When a scheduling mishap prevented that, their buddy tried a different approach: they welcomed Novica and Angie for supper at their house. </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The connection was instant, and the commitment came quickly after.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>To make matters worse, Novica had landed in Canada </span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>on a six-month visa in May 1991,&nbsp;as stated by The Athletic. The couple discussed ideas for Novica to leave Canada and return, but they were eventually abandoned. However, by the end of the year, they were married.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Married for 30 years, his mother utilized her schooling in Hamilton to become an IV nurse, mainly dealing with cancer patients at a leading cancer care facility.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Angie had intended to retire in January 2020 but was called back when COVID-19 strained personnel resources.</span></p><h2 id=johnathan-kovacevic-mother-angie><span class=ez-toc-section id=johnathan-kovacevic-mother-grew-up-without-electricity-or-running-water></span> Johnathan Kovacevic Mother Grew Up Without Electricity Or Running Water<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 25-year-old Johnathan Kovacevic’s journey to his first NFL game, which he played for the Jets, began outside of a small hamlet in Bosnia. His mother Angie was born there and grew up raised without running water or electricity.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>According to&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Athletic</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>, her family lived on a small subsistence farm, utilizing a horse and cart for mobility, until&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>emigrating to Canada</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;when she was eight years old.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, Angie’s parents bet that she and her two brothers’ lives would be smoother in Canada than they had been in Bosnia. She worked as an IV nurse at a premier Ontario hospital when her family first moved to Hamilton; they had neither English nor a college degree.</span></p><h2 id=johnathan-kovacevic-father-novica><span class=ez-toc-section id=his-father-novica-worked-as-a-software-engineer></span> His Father Novica Worked As A Software Engineer<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Novica (No-VEET-sa), the father of Jonathan Kovacevic, was raised in Sarajevo, Bosnia, where he enrolled at a prestigious technical institution.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Throughout the 1980s, his father worked as a software programmer in Sarajevo, traveling to locations like England and Japan for jobs before Yugoslavia’s gradual disintegration plunged into various conflicts.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Fortunately, Novica took the wise decision to begin a new life as the possibility of war loomed in 1988 and 1989. In May 1991, he left for Canada. A few weeks later, war broke out in Slovenia, and over the next years, it grew harrowingly worse in Croatia and Bosnia.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In Sarajevo, Novica had witnessed Muslims, Christians, and people of all ethnicities coexisting peacefully and working side by side, as reported by&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Athletic</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Without the Yugoslav Wars, he would have preferred to continue working and traveling in what had been an exquisite setting during the 1980s. Instead, in the summer of 1991, he discovered himself in Hamilton, secure, sound, and about to fall madly in love.</span></p><h2 id=johnathan-kovacevic-two-siblings-ryan-and-daniela><span class=ez-toc-section id=johnathan-kovacevic-two-siblings-ryan-and-daniela></span> Johnathan Kovacevic Two Siblings: Ryan And Daniela<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The 25-year-old defenseman Johnathan grew up with his two siblings, a brother named Ryan and a sister named Daniela.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Besides, his brother is also an engineer, and his sister is an occupational therapist who works with youngsters at the Waitemata District Health Board in New Zealand.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>In addition, she graduated from McMaster University with a Master of Science in occupational therapy in 2019, as per her</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;LinkedIn page</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKWfo8GzscClZJyZnpaxqrHNrGSdnZaau7SxzJqlZqKfnbuiwMeapWajn6uupLHVoppmqJGnsq%2FA0maqoaenmrFutc2tnKudo6l6qrqMpZyaqp6eu6h5x6iapJ2pYsSqwMdmn6KlXWd8</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmontreal-canadiens-defenseman-johnathan-kovacevic-parents-showed-interest-in-learning-hockey-with-him-2.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./osama-eisa-aka-partytilfajr-everything-on-domain-6-allegations.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./osama-eisa-aka-partytilfajr-everything-on-domain-6-allegations.html>Osama Eisa aka Partytilfajr Everything On Twitter Allegations</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./how-old-is-the-cast-of-heartstopper-in-real-life-the-real-ages-of-the-netflix-series-cast.html>How old is the cast of Heartstopper in real life?
