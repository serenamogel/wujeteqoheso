The PewDiePie channel is best known for its irreverent gaming content, shot in a “Let’s Play” style — videos of Kjellberg playing video games while giving an expletive-strewn running commentary. "Let’s play" became a hugely popular YouTube genre, and PewDiePie its superstar; his repertoire has expanded to include live-action and animated comedy shorts.</p><img alt="PewDiePie Photo" title="PewDiePie Photo" width=2520 height=3520 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-501661286.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j2">(Photo by Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images)</span><p>PewDiePie attends the European Premiere of ’Star Wars: The Force Awakens’ at Leicester Square on December 16, 2015 in London, England.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But as the Swede’s fame has grown, his behavior has become increasingly controversial. He apologized in 2012 for his use of “gay” and “retard” as supposedly playful insults and for making rape jokes — but after he posted videos containing anti-Semitic and Nazi imagery , he was dropped in February 2017 by his network partner, the Disney-owned Maker Studios; he was also ejected from YouTube’s Red platform and the Google Preferred program. He apologized, claiming his humor had been taken out of context, only to blurt the n-word months later during a live stream in September 2017. Like his videos, PewDiePie’s future appears to be disturbingly unpredictable.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">How Felix Kjellberg Became PewDiePie</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Felix Arvid Ulf Kjellberg was born on October 24, 1989, in Gothenburg, Sweden. His mother and father, Johanna and Ulf, are both successful chief executives. As a child, he enjoyed art and playing on his Super Nintendo; his obsession with video games grew during adolescence, during which he spent a lot of time gaming in his bedroom, or at internet cafes. “Sweden has a great culture around gaming,” he told Rolling Stone magazine in 2015. “We’re really nerdy people.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During his last year of high school, he bought a computer with money he made selling artwork through his grandmother’s gallery. He set up his first YouTube channel, PewDie, in 2006 — “pew” being slang for the sound of a laser gun firing — but as his interest in the channel waned, he forgot his password, so when he returned to YouTube in 2010, he was forced to set up a new account, PewDiePie.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">By now, Kjellberg had learnt to edit videos from an online tutorial, and uploaded his first "Let’s Play" video — of him playing Minecraft. He registered his PewDiePie account while at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, studying industrial economics and technology management. He struggled to fit in at Chalmers: “I had nothing in common with the rest of the people in the program,” he told Icon Magazine’s Maria Lindholm.</p><h2 data-node-id=12 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">Felix Kjellberg: From Hotdog Seller to Maker Studios Superstar</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">PewDiePie began to take off after Kjellberg filmed himself screaming his way around the horror game Amnesia, and began to receive requests from viewers for more of the same. He was soon uploading several clips a day, and eventually, to his parents’ horror, he dropped out of Chalmers in 2011 to work at a hotdog kiosk while he developed his channel.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">He reached his first 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Two months later, he had 2 million. By December that year, he had signed with Maker Studios — a talent network for video-makers that provides resources, expertise and help with promotion and marketing, in return for a share of ad revenue — and saw his channel quickly grow from 100 million to 200 million views per month. On August 15, 2013, PewDiePie became the most-subscribed YouTube channel in the world.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">PewDiePie and Marzia (CutiePie) Move to Brighton, Get Married</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In July 2013, Kjellberg moved to Brighton, a UK seaside town that has become a hub for YouTubers, with his Italian girlfriend, Marzia Bisognin, (nicknamed CutiePie) a beauty blogger. They were introduced online in 2011 and began a long-distance relationship, before living together in Italy, then Sweden, and eventually settling in Brighton — because of the town’s reliable internet connectivity — where they would share an apartment with two pet pugs, Edgar and Maya.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In August 2019, Kjellberg and Bisognin tied the knot in a private London ceremony. Announcing the union on Twitter, he wrote: “We are married!!! I’m the happiest I can be. I’m so lucky to share my life with this amazing woman.”</p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">PewDiePie’s Problems with Rants and Racism</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In August 2014, the same month Maker Studios launched a PewDiePie iPhone app, Kjellberg announced that he would be disabling the online comments under his YouTube videos, deeming them to be “mainly spam.” He partly relented in October, permitting “approved” comments only. In April 2016, he addressed his use of words such as “gay” and “retard” in earlier videos: “I just thought things were funny because they were offensive,” he claimed. “I would say a lot of stupid shit.” It seemed as if PewDiePie was finally starting to grow up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">But by November, his tone had changed again: he threatened to delete his channel once it reached 50 million subscribers, venting his frustration at YouTube over an allegedly unexplained loss of subscribers. Soon enough, he reached 50 million subscribers on December 8th — but did not delete the channel; instead he deleted a secondary channel, Jack septiceye2, on which he had only ever posted two videos, claiming that the whole thing had been “a joke.” The main PewDiePie channel would be an extremely lucrative source of income to give up, after all — according to Forbes, Kjellberg earned $15 million in 2016 (the total also included ad revenue from his YouTube Red channel and sales of 112,000 copies of his book, This Book Loves You).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following month, however, #PewDiePieIsOver and #PewDiePieIsOverParty began trending on Twitter, after Kjellberg appeared to use the n-word in a video. Days later, he caused further controversy by using the website Fiverr to pay two Indian men $5 to hold up a sign saying “Death to all Jews.” He apologized, claiming: “I didn’t think they would actually do it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Nevertheless, after other videos came to light that appeared to contain anti-Semitic jokes, Maker Studios severed ties with PewDiePie in February 2017. Kjellberg posted an apology, titled My Response, on February 17th — but also criticized the media’s reporting of his videos. But he found himself apologizing again in September 2017 after blurting the n-word during a live stream.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“I’m really disappointed in myself, because it seems I’ve learnt nothing from these past controversies,” he said. “Being in the position I am, I should know better.”</p><h2 data-node-id=24 class="css-a5dq20 e1k3dme10">100 Million Subscribers and Hiatus</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Although PewDiePie was overtaken by the Indian record label T-Series for the most-subscribed YouTube channel by spring 2019, he retained the top spot for an individually operated channel, surpassing 100 million subscribers in August.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">A few weeks later, the social media star again agitated critics by backing out of a pledge to donate $50,000 to the Anti-Defamation League. The social media star said he had been advised to select the nonprofit, to help quiet the accusations of anti-Semitism, though he preferred to donate the money to a charity he was "personally passionate about."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In December 2019, PewDiePie announced that he was taking a hiatus from the platform that had propelled him to fame.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">"I am taking (a) break from YouTube next year," he said in a video. "I wanted to say it in advance because I made up my mind. I'm tired, I'm feeling very tired. I don't know if you can tell ... early next year I'll be away for a little while. I'll explain that later but I wanted to give a heads up."</p><ul data-node-id=31 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Birth Year: 1989</li><li>Birth date: October 24, 1989</li><li>Birth City: Gothenburg</li><li>Birth Country: Sweden</li><li>Gender: Male</li><li>Best Known For: Swedish web-based comedian PewDiePie (Felix Kjellberg) is popular for his "Let's Play" YouTube commentaries.</li><li>Astrological Sign: Scorpio</li><li>Nacionalities</li><li>Interesting Facts</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Before PewDiePie became a YouTube sensation, he sold hot dogs.</li><li>According to Forbes, PewDiePie earned $15 million in 2016.</li></ul><li>Occupations</li><ul class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Social Media Personality</li></ul></ul><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">We strive for accuracy and fairness.If you see something that doesn't look right,<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/contact-us data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="contact us" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">contact us</a>!</p><br data-node-id=34><ul data-node-id=36 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>Article Title: PewDiePie Biography</li><li>Author: Biography.com Editors</li><li>Website Name: The Biography.com website</li><li>Url: https://www.biography.com/celebrities/pewdiepie-felix-kjellberg</li><li>Access Date:</li><li>Publisher: A&amp;E; Television Networks</li><li>Last Updated: December 16, 2019</li><li>Original Published Date: November 28, 2017</li></ul><ul data-node-id=39 class="css-yzf9pi e1k3dme10"><li>My parents said that sitting at home playing video games all day won't bring you anywhere in life.</li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o7XOoKmaqJiue6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmiolayxqrHPopxmnpWhtrl5yqOcpaSSmr%2Bo</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpewdiepie-felix-kjellberg.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./everything-you-need-to-make-the-ultimate-tiktok-feta-pasta.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./everything-you-need-to-make-the-ultimate-tiktok-feta-pasta.html>Heres Everything You Need to Buy</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./cooper-deru.html>Cooper Deru</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./cooper-deru.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
