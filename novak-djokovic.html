He began playing tennis at age 4 and turned pro in 2003 at age 16. After a steady ascent to the top levels of the sport, he won the Australian Open in 2008 and led the Serbian national team to its first Davis Cup win in 2010. In 2011, he claimed three of four Grand Slams and compiled a 43-match winning streak en route to the world’s No. 1 ranking. With his first French Open win in 2016, he became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four major titles at once. Djokovic has won 24 Grand Slam titles in his career—a record in men’s tennis.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts " data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Novak Djokovic<br>BORN: May 22, 1987<br>BIRTHPLACE: Belgrade, Serbia<br>SPOUSE: Jelena Djokovic (2014-present)<br>CHILDREN: Stefan and Tara<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Gemini</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Childhood and Amateur Career" data-anchor-id=childhood-and-amateur-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Childhood and Amateur Career</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Novak Djokovic was born on May 22, 1987, in Belgrade, Serbia. Father Srdjan and mother Dijana owned the company Family Sports, which had three restaurants and a tennis academy. Djokovic’s father, uncle, and aunt were all professional skiers, and his father also excelled at soccer, but young Djokovic was a tennis prodigy. His two younger brothers, Marko (born in 1991) and Djordje (born in 1995), both followed his path by pursuing professional tennis careers.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Djokovic began playing tennis at age 4, then in the summer of 1993, at 6 years old, Djokovic was spotted by Yugoslavian tennis legend Jelena Gencic at his parents’ sports complex. Gencic worked with Djokovic for the next six years.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">During this time, the war in former Yugoslavia and the bombing of Belgrade meant that, for almost three months, Djokovic and his family would spend a few hours in the middle of each night in the basement. Djokovic has said that the hardships of war drove him to pursue tennis with even greater determination.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">At 13, Djokovic was sent to the Pilic Academy in Munich to pursue higher levels of competition. In 2001, at age 14, he began his international career. He ended that year as a triple European champion in singles, doubles, and team competition. He won the silver medal at the World Junior Championship in a team competition for Yugoslavia. At 16, after winning five ITF tournaments, he was ranked the 40th best junior tennis player in the world.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 title="Professional Tennis Career" data-anchor-id=professional-tennis-career class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Professional Tennis Career</h2><img alt="novak djokovic pumps his fist and holds the french open trophy, he wears a red and black jacket with the number 23 on the front" title="Novak Djokovic after his 2023 French Open victory" width=5000 height=3333 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/novak-djokovic-of-serbia-poses-for-photos-with-his-news-photo-1689531491.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Novak Djokovic celebrates his 23rd Grand Slam win at the 2023 French Open.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2003, Djokovic turned pro, and 20 years on, the 36-year-old remains one of the most dominant players in men’s tennis. He won his first ATP Challenger tournament in 2004 in Budapest, where he started as a qualifier. The following year, Djokovic qualified at Wimbledon and reached the third round, moving him up the rankings and into the Top 100.</p><img alt="novak djokovic watches a tennis ball as he prepares to hit it on the run, he wears a black and blue adidas jersey and shorts" title="Novak Djokovic during a 2005 match at the Australian Open" width=2489 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/novak-djokovic-loses-first-round-match-against-marat-safin-news-photo-1689532240.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Novak Djokovic prepares to return a ball during a 2005 match at the Australian Open.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In the 2007 season, Djokovic played the semifinals of the French Open and Wimbledon. He won his second Masters title in Montreal, beating the Top 3 players—<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/roger-federer data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Roger Federer" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Roger Federer</a>, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/rafael-nadal data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rafael Nadal" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Rafael Nadal</a>, and Andy Roddick—which made him No. 3 in the world. He competed for Serbia in the 2008 Beijing Olympics and won a bronze medal in singles tennis. In 2010, the Serbian national team clinched the Davis Cup trophy for Serbia for the first time in history. Djokovic went on to win 43 matches in a row in 2011, the only player in the world to achieve such a run. That same year, he won the Australian Open, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Open to become the world’s No. 1 tennis player.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2012, Djokovic won the Australian Open singles title and made it to the semifinals at Wimbledon. He was beaten in the semifinals, however, by longtime rival Federer, who went on to win the Wimbledon final against <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/andy-murray data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andy Murray" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andy Murray</a>. Later that year, Djokovic faced off against Murray in the final at the U.S. Open. He fought hard against Murray, but he ended up losing the match after five sets.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">For the third year in a row, Djokovic took home the men’s singles title at the Australian Open in 2013. He was the runner-up at Wimbledon that year, losing in the final to Andy Murray. At the U.S. Open, Djokovic was the top-ranked player. He easily dispatched his opponents in the first three rounds of play, but he lost in the final to Rafael Nadal.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2014, Djokovic claimed his second Wimbledon title in an epic five-set win over seven-time champion Roger Federer. It was his seventh Grand Slam title. At the 2014 U.S. Open, Djokovic defeated Andy Murray to reach the semifinals for the eighth time. He was subsequently defeated in the semifinals by Japan’s Kei Nishikori, who became the first player from that country to make it to the Grand Slam final.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Tennis Greats</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Djokovic kicked off 2015 by winning the Australian Open over Andy Murray after a heated battle on the blue court. It was his fifth Australian Open title and the eighth Grand Slam title of his career. He then knocked off nine-time champion Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals of the French Open but fell short in his bid to claim his first French title with a loss to Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland in the final.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Djokovic was back in the thick of things at Wimbledon that July, defeating Richard Gasquet in the semifinals before upending Federer to win his third singles title on the famed grass courts. Facing Federer again in the rain-delayed 2015 U.S. Open final, Djokovic shrugged off a hard fall early in the match and eventually clinched a tough four-set win. The victory gave him his 10th major singles title and left him with an incredible 27-1 record in Grand Slam play for the year.</p><img alt="novak djokovic holds a silver trophy as he kisses it, he wears a red jacket and watch" title="Novak Djokovic after his 2016 French Open victory" width=4000 height=2740 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/novak-djokovic-of-serbia-holds-the-trophy-following-his-news-photo-1689532584.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Novak Djokovic achieved a career Grand Slam after winning the 2016 French Open.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The world’s No. 1 roared out of the gates to start the 2016 season, surging to his sixth Australian Open title. That June, following consecutive runner-up finishes at the French Open, he finally broke through with his first tournament win. The title made him the eighth man to complete the career Grand Slam and the first since Australia’s Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all for major titles at once. But Djokovic’s quest to win all the Grand Slams in a calendar year came to an abrupt end at Wimbledon when he was defeated by Sam Querry, an American player ranked No. 41, in the first week of competition. Later that year, he lost to Stan Wawrinka in the U.S. Open final.</p><h2 data-node-id=28 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">2017 Elbow Injury</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Following some disappointing results in early 2017, including a second-round loss at the Australian Open, Djokovic sought to shake things up by bringing tennis great <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/andre-agassi data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Andre Agassi" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Andre Agassi</a> on board as his new coach. He won the grass court Eastbourne International tournament that summer, but after retiring in the Wimbledon quarterfinals, he announced he was sitting out the remainder of the season to help his ailing right elbow recuperate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=30 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Djokovic ultimately underwent elbow surgery after his fourth-round loss at the 2018 Australian Open, and although he was shaky in his first tournaments following his return in March, the champion within showed signs of awakening.</p><h2 data-node-id=31 class="body-h3 css-gna8ot e1k3dme10">Wimbledon Comeback and Beyond</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In summer 2018, Djokovic outlasted Rafael Nadal in a marathon five-set semifinal at Wimbledon, before toppling South African Kevin Anderson to claim the 13th Grand Slam title of his career. Djokovic then captured his 14th Grand Slam title and third U.S. Open title by besting his 2016 Olympic nemesis, Juan Martín del Potro.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In January 2019, Djokovic defeated Nadal to claim a record seventh Australian Open singles title and his 15th overall major championship, breaking a tie with Pete Sampras for third-most all time. He added to his total by beating Federer in a thrilling five-set Wimbledon final that summer, though his run at the season’s final Grand Slam, the U.S. Open, came to a disappointing end when he retired from his fourth-round match versus Stan Wawrinka due to a shoulder injury.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The following February, Djokovic bounced back from a two-sets-to-one deficit against Austrian Dominic Thiem to grab his eighth Australian Open singles title, a win that also pushed him back into the top spot in the ATP rankings. When professional tennis resumed following a COVID-19 pandemic–induced suspension, the No. 1 seed was disqualified at the 2020 U.S. Open in the fourth round after accidentally hitting a line judge with a tennis ball.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">More Tennis Stories</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Back on the court in 2021, Djovokic proved the previous year’s events hadn’t slowed him down. He won three more majors—tallying his 20th Grand Slam title at Wimbledon—and was runner-up at the U.S. Open. At the Australian Open, he beat Daniil Medvedev of Russia, 7-5, 6-2, 6-2, in the final. Winning the French Open wasn’t as easy. In the four-hour-long title match against Greece’s Stefanos Tsitsipas, Djovokic was down the first two sets before rallying to clinch the trophy, 6-7 (6), 2-6, 6-3, 6-2, 6-4. His victory over Italian Mateo Berrettini, 6-7 (4), 6-4, 6-4, 6-3, at the Wimbledon placed the Serbian in a three-way tie with Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal for all-time Grand Slam men’s titles. Djokovic and Nadal have continued to compete for the outright record in subsequent majors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">The 2022 season frustrated Djokovic. Having chosen not to be vaccinated for COVID-19, he didn’t compete at the Australian or U.S. Opens. In the quarterfinals of the French Open, Djokovic faced Nadal, known for his dominance on clay courts, and lost 2-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-7 (4). His redemption came by defending his Wimbledon title for a fourth consecutive win, beating Australia’s Nick Krygios 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2023, the Serbian star fared much better, winning three Grand Slams.

His historic win at the French Open followed; a three-set sweep against Norwegian Casper Ruud saw Djokovic bypass Rafael Nadal for most Grand Slam men’s titles at a record 23. Although he made it to the Wimbledon final, Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz snapped Djokovic’s four-year winning streak there. The veteran player was frustrated throughout the competitive match, even breaking one of his racquets during the fifth set. Never down and out for long, Djokovic soared through the U.S. Open, breaking a tie with Federer after reaching his 47th major semifinal—the most of any man. His win over Medvedev in the final marked his fourth U.S Open title and 24th Grand Slam overall, surpassing <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/athletes/serena-williams data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Serena Williams" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Serena Williams</a> for the most Grand Slams of any player in the Open era.
